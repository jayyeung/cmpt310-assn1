To run command: 'python search.py'

The 'search_sim.py' is the main class that implements the searching of the grid.
The two classes (BFSSim & AStarSim) in 'search.py' just inherit from SearchSim and implement how the cost is calculated

The coordinates that are used and printed are in the form [x, y]
'/data' is where all the test data that I have (including assn1 test data)

You can change the txt file data in 'search.py' by changing the path of the test_data variable
